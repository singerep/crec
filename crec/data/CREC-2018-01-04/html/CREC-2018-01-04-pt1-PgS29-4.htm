                   Fort Smith, Arkansas, Bicentennial

  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the bicentennial of Fort 
Smith, AR.
  On Christmas Day in 1817, Army troops established a western frontier 
military post on the confluence of the Arkansas and Poteau Rivers. MAJ 
Stephen Long named it Fort Smith, after GEN Thomas Smith, commander of 
the U.S. Army rifle regiment.
  To recognize the significant milestone, the community is organizing a 
year-long celebration that highlights its rich history, its citizens, 
and its future. While Fort Smith was abandoned by 1824, the community 
that sprung up around it continued to grow and played a unique role in 
westward expansion and the preservation of law and order in our 
developing Nation.
  Judge Isaac Parker paved the way for bringing order to Indian 
Territory, and

great lawmen like Deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves helped lay the 
foundation that shaped Fort Smith's role in the history of the U.S. 
Marshals Service. Reeves was one of the most well-respected lawmen of 
all time. To recognize his efforts, the Bass Reeves Legacy Initiative 
raised money to honor him with a monument in the community's downtown.
  Reeves' career is well documented, as are the stories of Fort Smith 
during this period. In 1968, Charles Portis depicted Fort Smith's role 
in taming the West in his book ``True Grit,'' which portrays a teenage 
girl's efforts to avenge her father's death with a U.S. Marshal by her 
side.
  The bond between the community and the U.S. Marshals Service is 
strong and continues today, as Fort Smith will be the home of the 
future U.S. Marshals Museum scheduled to open in 2019. Part of its 
collection will include a gun and badge that belonged to Bass Reeves.
  The national historic site and other organizations have done an 
exceptional job of keeping the community's history alive. Promoting its 
history in this way will also have positive benefits for the future. 
Fort Smith is a city with an incredible story to tell in its faith 
communities, its schools, its industries, its arts, and its culture.
  The community is marking its bicentennial with events throughout the 
year that include an attempt to break the world record for a lip dub 
video at the Old Fort Days Rodeo Parade and the city's first fort 
building competition for kids.
  I was pleased to contribute to the time capsule, and I am looking 
forward to seeing many old friends at our high school reunion. A lot 
has changed since my days at Northside High School as a Grizzly, but 
the steadfast resilience and spirit of the citizens of Fort Smith have 
remained.
  I am proud to be a native of Fort Smith and look forward to the 
events during this year-long celebration. It is home to a growing 
university, new medical school, and vibrant new industries.
  I know Fort Smith is starting the 21st century on a solid foundation. 
We have much to celebrate from the past, but even more to look forward 
to in the future. We are forever grateful to the men and women who have 
encouraged the community's progress and implemented their ideas to 
shape the city for the next generation.
  Dr. Jerry Stewart is one such leader, who led a life dedicated to 
public service. He had a successful career as a pulmonologist and 
served as CEO of Cooper Clinic, leading the growth and development of 
one of the region's top medical care providers. After his retirement, 
he helped underserved patients at the Good Samaritan Clinic in River 
Valley Primary Care.
  He was well respected in the medical community and admired for his 
influence beyond the walls of the clinic. His influence was felt across 
the community as a leader in civic organizations and community boards, 
including serving on the Fort Smith Public School Board and as chairman 
of the board for the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce and the Fort Smith 
United Way. Truly, the list goes on and on.
  Dr. Stewart passed away December 26, but his legacy will live on. I 
appreciated and valued his friendship and, like so many others, will 
greatly miss him.
  Fort Smith was blessed with Dr. Stewart's leadership and his 
guidance. It continues to be fortunate to have talented leaders with a 
vision and dedication to make this great city even better.
  Congratulations to the members of the 200th anniversary committee for 
all of their hard work in planning to celebrate 200 years of Fort Smith 
history. I am excited for the community as it comes together to 
recognize and commemorate this historic milestone and wish all the very 
best as the events take place throughout 2018.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  The Senator from Connecticut.
