                        Tribute to Alex Schenck

  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about one of the members of 
my staff, who happens to be on the floor with me right now. Alex 
Schenck, unfortunately for me, is leaving my office on January 5 to 
pursue another opportunity in Washington, DC.
  Alex has been in my office since 2015. He has been a legislative 
correspondent and rose to be a legislative aide where he oversaw issues 
related to my work on both the Environment and Public Works Committee 
and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Most notably 
and importantly for this body and, I believe, for the entire country, 
Alex was the key member of my staff who drafted S. 756, the Save Our 
Seas Act, the SOS Act, an important bipartisan piece of legislation we 
worked on with Senator Whitehouse and others. It passed the Senate last 
year.
  This legislation, which is awaiting movement in the House, will 
address a very important issue not only for Alaska but for the entire 
country, which is the epidemic of marine debris affecting our oceans, 
our shorelines, inland waterways, coasts across the globe, fish and 
wildlife habitat, and the health and sustainability of our fisheries.
  What Alex was able to do in terms of this bill is very impressive. He 
brought together an impressive coalition of industry and conservation 
groups to support the bill. In addition to working on that important 
legislation--which we are hopeful will move in the House and get signed 
by the President--Alex ran point on hearings that I chaired at the 
Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard.
  He has a bachelor of science degree from High Point University in 
North Carolina and a master's degree in applied political science from 
American University. He is an avid outdoorsman, as you can probably 
tell. He is a good-natured and extremely hard-working member of my 
team.
  He will be sorely missed. We wish him the very best.
  Thank you, Alex.
  I yield the floor
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
