                            Tax Reform Bill

  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, Republicans just passed the largest tax 
reform package in 30-something years, and middle America will go home 
in February with bigger paychecks than they did--I say in February 
because it will not take that long for the IRS to update their 
software. They will go home with more money in their pockets.
  If there has been a theme in the Trump administration, it is that 
they want those working Americans, those middle-class Americans, to do 
better under this President than they did in the previous 8 years. That 
tax reform package is part of that, and I am amazed that my Democratic 
colleagues objected to it. They objected to middle-class Americans 
having more money in their pockets, in their take-home pay, for no 
other reason, I think, than to resist President Trump.
